# stops-away

run stops_away.rb to show stops away for all supported stations

create_db.rb takes the data from the spreadsheet below (in CSV form) and turns it into a SQLite DB. Westbound stations that were in common between all the sheets are separated into their own CSV, so there's one more CSV than there are sheets in the spreadsheet.

Original spreadsheet from MBTA: https://www.dropbox.com/s/a5xtacqw44ijyaw/Stops_Away_for_developers.xlsx?dl=0
